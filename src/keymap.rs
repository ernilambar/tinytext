//! Every key binding in the app.

//! Bindings are split in two groups. The app bindings are global and match
//! regardless of focus. The editor bindings use gpui-kit's `"Input"` key
//! context, so they only fire while a text editor has focus. The editor
//! bindings are registered after `gpui_kit::init` has installed the engine's
//! own defaults; at equal context depth the later registration wins, so these
//! take precedence where they overlap with the engine.
