# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Codex) working in this repository.

## Overview

Tinytext is a native macOS text editor written in Rust. It builds its UI with
[GPUI Kit](https://gpui-kit.com) (`gpui-kit`), which bundles GPUI, GPUI Base, and GPUI
Component, and uses `ropey` plus `tree-sitter` for text buffering and syntax parsing.

## Setup

Requirements: Rust 1.92 or later, macOS 15 or later, and Xcode Command Line Tools.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ernilambar/tinytext.git
cd tinytext
xcode-select --install
rustup component add rustfmt clippy
cargo build
```

`cargo build` fetches and compiles all dependencies. The first build compiles GPUI and is
slow; later builds are fast.

## Commands

Run every command from the repository root.

- Build: `cargo build`
- Release build: `cargo build --release`
- Test: `cargo test`
- Lint: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Format: `cargo fmt`
- Format check: `cargo fmt --check`
- Typecheck: `cargo check`
- Run the app: `cargo run`
- Run and restart on save: `bacon run`
- Install bundle to `/Applications` and relaunch: `./scripts/dev.sh [--release]`

`cargo run` opens a native window and needs a graphical macOS session; do not rely on it
in headless environments.

## Conventions

- Use `gpui-kit` as the only UI dependency. Import GPUI via `use gpui_kit::*;` and
  components via `gpui_kit::component`. Do not add `gpui` or `gpui-component` directly —
  the kit pins their versions together.
- Bring element helper traits into scope: `use gpui_kit::base::StyledExt as _;` for
  `.h_flex()` / `.v_flex()`, and `use gpui_kit::component::ActiveTheme as _;` for
  `cx.theme()`.
- Never edit `Cargo.lock` by hand; regenerate it with a `cargo` command.
- Module layout: `main.rs` (entry, actions, keybindings), `app/` (`TinytextApp` state;
  `files.rs`, `tabs.rs`, `ui.rs` hold further `impl TinytextApp` blocks), and GPUI-free
  helpers in `cli.rs`, `language.rs`, `paths.rs`, `session.rs`, `settings.rs`,
  `update.rs`. Code under `app/` reads private fields directly; cross-file methods use
  `pub(super)`. Add a new module only once a feature is large enough to justify the
  boundary.
- `session.json` (app-written state) and `settings.json` (user-authored preferences) both
  live in `paths::support_dir()`. The app never rewrites `settings.json`; it only creates
  a starter file. Group new settings keys by area (`editor.*`, `ui.*`).
- This project targets macOS only. Do not add cross-platform code paths.

## Releasing

`version` in `Cargo.toml` is the single source of truth. The About dialog, `--version`
output, and the bundle's `Info.plist` read it at build time; never hardcode a version
anywhere else.

To release a new version:

1. Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`.
2. Run `cargo build` so `Cargo.lock` picks up the new version (do not edit it by hand).
3. If the year changed, update `copyright` under `[package.metadata.bundle]`.
4. Pass the quality gate and report the changes.

The maintainer tags `vX.Y.Z` and pushes it; the tag must match the `Cargo.toml` version
exactly. `.github/workflows/release.yml` then builds, ad-hoc signs, and publishes
`Tinytext-macos-arm64.zip` to a GitHub Release. Do not rename that asset:
`scripts/install.sh` downloads it by name.

## Quality gate

Before declaring any task complete, run these in order and confirm every one exits 0:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo build
```

A future-incompatibility warning from the transitive `block` crate is expected and is not
a failure. If any command fails, fix the cause and rerun the full sequence. Do not run
`git add` or `git commit` unless explicitly asked; report uncommitted work instead.
